# Dependencies

This notebook uses python 3.11; as well as the  torch, pandas, transformers, matplotlib, numpy, and sklearn packages.

# Download pretrained models

Due to size restrictions, I was unable to upload my pretrained models to the github repo. They can be downloaded at this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/147wG5ntwDT7KR7SYOeLRwi9ssvw6acqi?usp=sharing). Each of the folders should be added to the root level of the repo in order for the notebook to function correctly.

# Instructions

This notebook can be run in its entirity. There is a TRAIN_MODEL flag that ensures that the lengthy model training is not run and instead relies on the pretrained models.
